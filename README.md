Analyzing churn rates with SQL

- SQL code is provided
- My presentation/write up includes 14 slides in PDF format

In this project I analyzed user subscription churn rates for a (fictional) streaming video startup company. Throughout the process, I also illustrated the process of transforming the original table into a new one suited for calculating churn rates. Last, I concluded with my findings and recommendations.

Dataset was accessed and provided by Codecademy.
